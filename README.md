# Minesweeper Reborn

##Introduction

Do you remember Minesweeper from your old computer back in the days? You can find lots of clones online but with the same default Windows design.

So for my first project as a General Assembly WDI student, I'm glad to introduce you a new, flat, modern version of it. Let's make this game alive again.

Happy mine hunting!

##Game instructions

The goal is to open all the cells of the board which do not contain a bomb. If you open a cell with a bomb, BOOM you blow up!

Every non-bomb cell you open will tell you the total number of bombs in the eight neighboring cells. If you open a cell with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open.

Once you are sure that a cell contains a bomb, you can just right-click to flag/unflag it.

You win when you have correctly flagged all the cells with bombs.

##Technology stack

jQuery / Bower / Bootstrap


##Installation

1. Clone the repository on your computer
2. Open your terminal and type 'bower install' in your game directory to install all the dependancies. If you don't have bower, please go to http://bower.io/ to find installation instructions.
4. Open index.html and enjoy the game!

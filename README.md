# Minesweeper Reborn

##Game instructions

The goal is to open all the cells of the board which do not contain a bomb. If you open a cell with a bomb, BOOM you blow up!

Every non-bomb cell you open will tell you the total number of bomb in the eight neighboring cells. If you open a cell with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open.

Once you are sure that a cell contains a bomb, you can just right-click to flag/unflag it.

You win when you have correctly flagged all the cells with bombs.

Happy mine hunting!
